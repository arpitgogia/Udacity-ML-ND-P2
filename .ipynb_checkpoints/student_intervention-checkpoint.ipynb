    "        1. Assuming Strong Independence among features\n",
    "    * Why it is suitable?\n",
    "        * In my opinion most of the features shown in this data set are independent of each other and hence Naive Bayes can be applied. It is efficient in learning as well as predicting and uses **probability** for predicition which makes it pretty accurate.<br><br>\n",
    "2. **Support Vector Machines**: SVM algorithms are non probabilistic binary linear classifier algorithms. In addition to this SVMs can be used for non linear classification as well using the Kernel Trick.\n",
    "    * General Applications: \n",
    "        1. Classification of images can also be performed using SVMs. Experimental results show that SVMs achieve significantly higher search accuracy than traditional query refinement schemes after just three to four rounds of relevance feedback.\n",
    "        2. Hand-written characters can be recognized using SVM.\n",
    "        3. The SVM algorithm has been widely applied in the biological and other sciences. They have been used to classify proteins with up to 90% of the compounds classified correctly. \n",
    "        (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_machine)\n",
    "    * Advantages: \n",
    "        1. Robust model because of maximization of margin.\n",
    "        2. Supports kernels which is a big advantage against simple linear classification. Kernels are supported by a few other models as well but SVM is kind of based on kernels so using kernels is easier with SVM.\n",
    "    * Disadvantages: \n",
    "        1. Requires full labeling of input data\n",
    "        2. Uncalibrated class membership probabilities\n",
    "        3. Parameters of a solved model are difficult to interpret\n",
    "        4. Space Complexity O(n^2) and time complexity O(n^3)\n",
    "    * Why it is suitable?\n",
    "        * It is a binary classifier supporting finite dimensions(using Kernels) so I believe it can accurately make predictions. The data we want to classify here is also binary in nature (Passed or Failed).<br><br>\n",
    "3. **Random Forest Classifier**: Combines random decision trees with bagging to achieve high classification accuracy. \n",
    "    * General Applications: \n",
    "        1. Internet traffic interception - certain governments (possibly from the middle east) would like to restrict certain categories of web pages. For example, due to religious restrictions, certain movie pages may be restricted/censored. \n",

    "        3. Image classification - classic problem in image processing. Is this an image of a dog or a cat?\n",

    "        3. Fast run times and quite scalable. Space and learning complexity are both roughly O(NlogN) where N is the number of elements in the dataset.\n",
    "    * Disadvantages: \n",
    "        1. This algorithm may overfit to the training data. If the decision trees used in each iteration overfit to a subset of the data, we may end up getting zero error every time which ultimately will result in overfitting of the data.\n",

    "We can also notice that the F1 scores are consistently higher for the Support Vector Machine (except the Random Forest Classifier score on Training set which probably shows that the RFC is overfitting to the training data) and in a general trend, appear to be increasing with increasing data size.<br>\n",
    "Therefore, it is safe to say that I choose the **Support Vector Machine SVC** model as the best model considering all physical factors. Granted that SVMs have a quadratic space and cubic time complexity respectively but in a general trend a properly trained SVM can result in a consistently high F1 Score. Considering we need to reach a graduation rate of 95%, the extra processing/prediction is negligible. An SVM can be tweaked in many ways to increase the F1 Score like tweaking the kernel for better classification. Usage of Kernels is one of the main advantages of the SVM."
